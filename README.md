# decoder
Decoder (commercially known as Mastermind or Codebreaker) is a classic board game implemented here with React and TypeScript. The project was done to test a simple store implementation with Recoil, Redux and Context API. All three versions run simultaneously under different routes, using localStorage for data persistence. Other libraries include React-Bootstrap, Styled components and Redux Toolkit.
